# TalkWall

This prototype was created for the specialisation course "Social Computing" by Team 3 during the Summer Semester 2023.

TalkWall is a gamified sociotechnical systems, and will later in the course be evaluated using empirical means. The developed website is meant to be permanently open on several computers across campus. This offers a way for students to connect casually across campus, fostering a more lively in-place learning atmosphere. Students can write messages, which can be signed or anonymous. For ease of use, no account registration or similar is required. Furthermore, students can drag the created messages around on screen. This allows for freely placing your message near existing messages you might want to be in conversation with.

The system is meant to be easy of use, as well as promote connection on campus in a fun way.

This prototype showcases the most important functionality and design elements offered by TalkWall. Later development tools might include database-storage, admin tools and snychronized cross-computer messages.
